Vignettte Automation Scripts
>These scripts are for the backend.  They MUST be run in python27.

To run in Python27 do the following:
>Start -> Run -> cmd
Copy the path to the Vignette File with your name associated with it (Color Change > VignetteAutomation) 
and enter the following command to switch that to your working directory:

>pushd "path/to/folder"

Call the VignetteAutomation_v2 script (hint: you can autocomplete the name by hitting tab and then typing 
the rest of the name of your specific script):
>python VignetteAutomation_v1-yourname.py
